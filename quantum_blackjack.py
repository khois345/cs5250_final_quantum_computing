# Description: We use Qiskit to implement a quantum version of the Blackjack game.
# The game is played between a player and a dealer. The player can choose to hit or stand.
# The dealer will reveal their hand and the player will win if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand.

# The game uses quantum circuits to simulate the randomness of card drawing.
# The player and dealer's hands are represented as quantum states, and the game logic is implemented using Qiskit.
# The game is played in a Jupyter notebook environment, and the player can interact with the game using a simple command line interface.
# THIS IS A PYTHON FILE VERSION OF THE GAME

## BEFORE RUNNING THE CODE, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE FOLLOWING LIBRARIES INSTALLED: QISKIT AND QISKIT-AER
# You can install them using pip:
# pip install qiskit
# pip install qiskit-aer

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_aer import Aer

def draw_card():
    # Create a quantum circuit with 4 qubits
    qc = QuantumCircuit(4)
    qc.h(range(4))  # Apply Hadamard gate to put qubits in superposition
    qc.measure_all()  # Measure all qubits

    # Use the Aer simulator to execute the circuit
    simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
    job = simulator.run(qc, shots=1)  # Run the circuit with 1 shot
    
    # Get the result of the measurement
    result = job.result() 
    counts = result.get_counts()

    # Convert the measured binary string to an integer (1-10 for card values)
    binaryResult = list(counts.keys())[0]
    cardValue = int(binaryResult, 2) % 10 + 1
    return cardValue
