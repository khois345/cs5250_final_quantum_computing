    "**Classical computers** performs calculations and operations using **bits**: 0 or 1. \n",
    "**Quantum computers**, on the other hand, handle them using **qubits**, which can be in **superposition**: both 0 and 1 at the same time.\n",
    "- Due to its nature, quantum computers are **a lot faster** than traditional computers, but they also require **more energy** to execute an operation.\n",
    "- Qubits can also be **entangled**, meaning one affects the other.\n",
    "- When measured, a qubit 'collapses' to either 0 or 1.\n",

    "The difference between a classical bit is similar to a coin on the table where the result is either head or tail, while a qubit is like a spinning coin, having the value being both head and tail simutanenously."
